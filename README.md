Fokker Planck Solvers for CR Transport Equation

Fokker Planck Solver Types: 1)Chang-Cooper Scheme
                            2)Coarse Grain Momentum Volume Scheme
                           
Simulations: 1)Test particle Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA)
             2)DSA Modified Hydrodynamic Shocks                           
                            
Note: These numerical methods are stable and first order accurate, and can be applied 
to general parabolic partial differential equations. 


Note:For the CGMV scheme, need to set spatial boundary conditions appropriately. Particle injection not currently working properly. Root solver fails. Need to fix.
